  This plugin converts a Jenkins OSS installation into a Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees installation.
  <b>Note:</b> As part of the installation process, you will require a valid license to use the CloudBees Enterprise
  plugins. An evaluation license can be obtained automatically. Once the evaluation license expires,
  you must either obtain a full license OR uninstall the plugins requiring such a license.
